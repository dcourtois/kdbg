This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around GDB using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To build and install:

        git clone https://github.com/j6t/kdbg.git
        cmake -S kdbg -B kdbg-build
        cmake --build kdbg-build
        sudo cmake --install kdbg-build

You'll need the following packages:

        extra-cmake-modules
        libkf5i18n-dev
        libkf5config-dev
        libkf5iconthemes-dev
        libkf5xmlgui-dev
        libkf5windowsystem-dev


It may be necessary to tell the install location explicitly,
then use, for example,

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr kdbg-build

The KDE header files libraries must be available. Make sure
that the development packages are installed.
