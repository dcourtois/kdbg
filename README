This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around GDB using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To build and install:

        cmake .
        make
        sudo make install

It may be necessary to tell the install location explicitly,
then use, for example,

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

The KDE header files libraries must be available. Make sure
that the development packages are installed.
